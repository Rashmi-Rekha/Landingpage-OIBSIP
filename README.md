# Landingpage-OIBSIP
Successfully completed Task 1 of my internship with Oasis Infobyte! Designing a landing page using HTML and CSS is a great achievement.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating the structure and content of web pages. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and format the HTML elements, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of the webpage.
By successfully designing a landing page, demonstrated my proficiency in these fundamental web development technologies. 
In this project i had used HTML for heading , navbar, logo, content, images, contact section etc and css for designing all those features added in html .
